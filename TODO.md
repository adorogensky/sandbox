# TODO
* why intellij's "build and run using gradle" and "run tests using gradle" dont work?
* add ng-rx
* android modules and priorities

# PRIORITIES
create stats for 7 work days
* use numbers 0, 1, 2 and 3 for languages/libararies i used to identify how much "read up" time i needed to solve tech challenges
* 0 - means no time or almost no time
* 1 - means some time
* 2 - means approx 2x of what 1 means
* 3 - means approx 3x of what 1 means
* use decimals from 1 to 2.5 to identify how much i think i will benefit from learning this language/library in the short and long run average
* ``value score = read up score * benefit``

For example

| Language/Library | Read Up Score | Benefit Score | Value Score
| -- | -- | -- | -- 
| Kotlin | 2 | 2 | 4.0
| Angular | 2 | 1.6 | 3.2
| CSS | 2 | 1.5 | 3.0
| JavaScript | 2 | 1.5 | 3.0
| TypeScript | 0 | - | 0.0
| Java | 0 | - | 0.0
| Ng Rx | 0 | - | 0.0
| Karma | 0 | - | 0.0
| Jasmine | 0 | - | 0.0
| Android | 0 | - | 0.0
