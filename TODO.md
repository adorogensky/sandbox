# TODO
* why intellij's "build and run using gradle" and "run tests using gradle" dont work?
* add ng-rx
* android modules and priorities

# PRIORITIES
create stats for 7 work days
* use numbers 0, 1, 2 and 3 for languages/libararies i used to identify how much "read up" time i needed to solve tech challenges
* 0 - means no time or almost no time
* 1 - means some time
* 2 - means approx 2x of what 1 means
* 3 - means approx 3x of what 1 means
* use decimals from 1 to 2.5 to identify how much i think i will benefit from learning this language/library in the short and long run average
* ``value score = read up score * benefit``

For example

| Language/Library | Read Up Score | Benefit Score | Value Score
| -- | -- | -- | -- 
| Kotlin | 2 | 2 | 4.0
| Angular | 2 | 1.6 | 3.2
| CSS | 2 | 1.5 | 3.0
| JavaScript | 2 | 1.5 | 3.0
| TypeScript | 0 | - | 0.0
| Java | 0 | - | 0.0
| Ng Rx | 0 | - | 0.0
| Karma | 0 | - | 0.0
| Jasmine | 0 | - | 0.0
| Android | 0 | - | 0.0
  
# NEXT PRIORITIES
* python
  * why:
    * lightweight
    * versataile
      * server
      * linux desktop
      * dev ops and scripting
      * data science
      * well adopted across varying software platforms: Linux, Windows, MacOS
    * concise
    * popular and improving
  * what: basic language structure

# UNPROCESSED
# MIGRATION
nice to have -- or is it a must have?? -- preserve git history
 + i will have my old history saved: 2019-2023 (5 years -- 4 years were active) vs 2023 (1 year) -- very strong argument
 - complexity, specifically: how to import git history from one repository into a subtry of another (non-empty) repository
 - will i ever use that history? not sure
 - will I BE ABLE to use that history after rename? it will be hard to track file changes at minimum

1. angular-training -> www/angular (merge)
2. hello-service -> java/server/echo-service-java
3. alpha -> java/server/services/user-service-java
4. spring-boot-training -> java/server/services/user-service-java 
5. hibernate-training -> java/server/data/spring-boot-jpa-hibernate-java bz it can be -kotlin 
6. java-training -> java/core
7. kafka-training -> java/server/data/kafka or spring-boot-kafka
8. sql-training -> sql/postgres
9. react-training -> www/react 
10. vue-training -> www/vue
11. linux-glibc-training -> linux/glibc
12. mongo-db-training -> nosql/mongodb
13. gnome3-python-training -> linux/gnome3/python
14. fetch_reward_test -> java/assesments/fetch-reward
15. unzip_v_jar_test => tests/performance/zip-v-jar-list
    - cannot reproduce.. where do i get the jre lib file that was so slow??
16. tech_quiz => rename
17. sql/mysql, sql/sql-server, sql/oracle
18. ios
19. go
20. scala
21. bash
22. perl? -- scripting with focus on data processing
23. rust?

# DO NOT LEARN OR DO MINIMUM
c#: 
 - microsoft: company have been fighting open source long enough to have that ingrained in its dna
 
typescript:
 - same as above
  
php: 
 - illogical behavior in syntax and features
 - flexibility => poor code practices
 - history of security vulnerabilities
 - fragmented community => problem with standardization
 - performance issues
 
ruby: 
 - because why when there is 
   - python
   - javascript
   - java
   - go
