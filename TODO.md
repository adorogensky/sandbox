# TODO
* fix intellij run problem in java-kotlin project/hello-world-kotlin module
* add ng-rx
* kotlin vs java basic operations list
* android modules and priorities

# PRIORITIES
* angular
  * javascript: work
  * typescript: work
  * ngrx: work
  * karma: work
  * jasmine: work
* html-view
  * html: work
  * css: work
  * bootstrap
* android
  * why: android app development naturally appealing
  * what: screen layouts, presentation
* kotlin (vs java)
  * why: work and android dev
  * what: basic language structure, coroutines, java-kotlin gap
* java
  * why: work, future work projects, interviews
  * what: classic algorithms and computational problems (leetcode)

# NEXT PRIORITIES
* python
  * why:
    * lightweight
    * versataile
      * server
      * linux desktop
      * dev ops and scripting
      * data science
      * well adopted across varying software platforms: Linux, Windows, MacOS
    * concise
    * popular and improving
  * what: basic language structure

# UNPROCESSED
* refactor
  * data class Greeting(text="..")
  * null safety typed features
  * 3 links at the end: strings, collections, nullability
  * kotlin generics
  * invariant kotlin arrays
  * kotlin doesnt have wildcard types it has use-site variance and type projections
  * kotlin doesnt have checked exceptions, all exceptions are unchecked
  * kotlin doesnt have any primitive types
  * kotlin doesnt have static member, instead use these
    * companion objects
    * top-level functions
    * extension functions
    * @JvmStatic
  * a ? b : c === if(a) b else c
  * unique kotlin features
    * lambda expressions + inline functions
    * extension functions
    * null safety
    * smart casts
    * string templates
    * properties
    * primary constructors
    * 1st class delegation
    * type inference for variable and property types
    * singletons
    * declaration-site & type projections
    * range expressions
    * operator overloading
    * companion objects
    * data classes
    * separate interfaces for read-only and mutable collections
    * coroutines
